# UserPass-in-Bulk-mode
 
This script has been created after a colleague of mine asked "Could you create, as fast as possible, one hundred VPN SSL users?"
I created an ugly script to get the job done in 10 minutes, then I decided to create something more polished than the first version. 

This script is nothing exceptional and uncommon, it is very bad and not pleasant to read. 
I will update it in the future, when I will have more time to spend on coding (sigh).


Oh, btw, the script's language is Italian, will update in english soon.
